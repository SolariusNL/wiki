## What is Framework?

Framework is a free (as in freedom and as in free beer), powerful game platform. We aim to provide a safe, secure, and fun environment for all users by providing a platform that is free of censorship and mass moderation.

Our target audience is anyone who wants to create and play games, but we're especially focused on those who are tired of the limitations and censorship of other platforms. We believe that everyone should have the right to express themselves and create the games they want to create, without fear of being banned or censored.

Framework provides many features that are not available on Roblox, such as:
.

- A community-first approach, where the community is in control of the direction of the project and the features that are added rather than investors or numbers on spreadsheets.
- A focus on privacy and security, with end-to-end encryption implemented in many places and a focus on making sure that your data is safe and secure from prying eyes. (We're GDPR and CCPA compliant)
- A focus on user experience, with a clean and simple interface that is easy to use and understand.
- ...and many, many more!
