## Introduction

This Custom Client Policy (the "Policy") applies to all custom clients (the "Client(s)") that interact with our federated, open-source platform, Framework (the "Service"). By using any Client, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, you may not use any Client. Failure to comply with this Policy may result in termination of your access to the Service.

## Compliance with Laws

Clients must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to laws related to data protection, intellectual property, and online conduct. Any Client found to be in violation of any laws or regulations may be removed from the Service and reported to the appropriate authorities.

## Intellectual Property Rights

Clients must not infringe on the rights of any third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights. This includes, but is not limited to, copyright, trademark, and patent rights. Any Client found to be in violation of any third party's intellectual property rights may be removed from the Service and reported to the appropriate authorities.

## Illegal or Malicious Activity

Clients must not be used to engage in any illegal or malicious activity, including but not limited to hacking, phishing, or distributing malware. Any Client found to be engaging in illegal or malicious activity may be removed from the Service and reported to the appropriate authorities.

## Unfair Advantage

Clients must not be used to gain an unfair advantage over other players, including but not limited to cheating, exploiting, or automating gameplay, unless the game author has explicitly permitted such use.

If the game author has explicitly permitted the use of unfair advantage, it is the player's responsibility to comply with any additional rules or guidelines set forth by the game author. Any Client found to be providing an unfair advantage to its users in violation of any such rules or guidelines may be removed from the Service and the associated user may be banned from the Service.

## Alteration of Gameplay Experience

Clients must not alter the normal gameplay experience for other players. This includes, but is not limited to, modifying the game's user interface, camera angles, or physics. Any Client found to be altering the gameplay experience for other players may be removed from the Service.

## Collection of Personal Information

Clients must not collect any personal information from players without their express consent. This includes, but is not limited to, names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. Any Client found to be collecting personal information without consent may be removed from the Service and reported to the appropriate authorities.

## Open-Source

Clients must be open-source and provide the source code to the community. This allows other developers to contribute to the project and make sure that the Clients are safe and comply with the policy.

## Identification

Clients must be clearly labeled as such and not misrepresent themselves as official clients. Misrepresenting the Client as an official client may lead to confusion and a poor experience for the users, and for that reason, any such Client will be removed from the Service.

## Disclaimer of Liability

We are not responsible for any harm caused by the use of any Client, including but not limited to loss of data, hardware damage, or financial loss. By using any Client, you assume all risks associated with its use.

## Changes to the Policy

We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. Any changes to this Policy will be posted on our website and will become effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of any Client following the posting of changes to this Policy will be deemed acceptance of those changes.

This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Noord-Holland, Netherlands, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Noord-Holland, Netherlands to resolve any legal matter arising from this Policy.

## Severability
