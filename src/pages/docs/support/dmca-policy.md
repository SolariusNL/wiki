title: DMCA Takedown Policy
description: Our DMCA Takedown Policy is designed to protect the rights of our users and the integrity of our platform.
---

Our platform respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. In accordance with the European Union's copyright laws, we will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement that are reported to our designated copyright agent, identified below.

## Public Disclosure of DMCA Requests

We take transparency and openness very seriously, and as such, we will publicly disclose all DMCA requests that we receive. This includes the name of the copyright holder, the infringing material, and the action that we have taken in response to the request. 

This disclosure serves to inform the public about the nature and frequency of DMCA requests that we receive, and allows interested parties to see the specific details of each request. It also serves as a deterrent for those who may consider submitting false or fraudulent requests.

Please note that we will remove personal information from the disclosure in order to protect the privacy of the individuals involved.

## Reporting copyright infringements

If you believe that content available on our platform infringes one or more of your copyrights, please submit a notification ("Infringement Notice") containing the following information to our designated copyright agent:

- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
- Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address;
- A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

## Counter-Notices

If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content, you may send a counter-notification containing the following information to our designated copyright agent:

- Your physical or electronic signature;
- Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
- A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content;
- Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the court in the Netherlands and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

## Repeat Infringers

We will promptly terminate without notice any user who is determined to be a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had a user submission removed from our platform more than twice.

## Designated Copyright Agent

The designated copyright agent(s) to receive notification of claimed infringement is:
| Name | Email | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cheon-Sa Park | seeun@soodam.rocks | European Union, Other Countries |
| Emil Osmicevic | emil@soodam.rocks | United States, Canada, Other Countries |

## Consequences of False or Misleading Information

It is important to note that under the DMCA, any person who knowingly makes a false or misleading statement in a notification of claimed infringement or counter-notification may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, the copyright owner or their respective licensees, or the service provider, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

Additionally, providing false or misleading information may also be considered a criminal offense. We take the accuracy of the information provided in notifications and counter-notifications very seriously and will take appropriate action against any person who knowingly provides false or misleading information.
