description: Help us improve the platform and earn rewards for your efforts.

Our bug bounty program is designed to reward users who help us improve the security and stability of our platform. For every reproducible bug report submitted, we will reward users with tickets based on the severity and nature of the issue.

Here’s how it works:

## Report a bug

- **Security vulnerabilities** If you discover a security vulnerability in Framework, please reach out to us immediately at `security@soodam.rocks`. This will allow us to address the issue quickly and prevent any potential harm.
- **Ordinary bugs** For ordinary bugs (spelling/grammar issues, UX issues), you can report them in one of the following ways:
  - File an issue at our GitLab instance: [https://invent.soodam.rocks/Soodam.re/framework](https://invent.soodam.rocks/Soodam.re/framework)
  - Contact us through our support form: [https://framework.soodam.rocks/support](https://framework.soodam.rocks/support)
  - Reach out to a staff member on Discord

## Review and validation

Our team will review your report and verify its validity. If we determine that the issue is indeed a bug, we’ll reach out to you for additional information and to provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

## Ticket reward

Upon successful resolution of the issue, you will receive a ticket reward based on the severity of the bug, as outlined in our reward table below:

| Severity        | Reward    |
| --------------- | --------- |
| Low severity    | **80T$**  |
| Medium severity | **160T$** |
| High severity   | **400T$** |

1. "T$" is the abbreviation for the virtual currency on Framework, Tickets.
