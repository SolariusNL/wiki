Our referral code system is a way for users to earn rewards by sharing their unique code with friends and family, and attract new users to our platform. Here are some important details to keep in mind when using the referral code system:

## Eligibility
In order to enter another user's referral code, your account must be less than one month old. This is to prevent users from creating new accounts to enter referral codes.

We know this is not a foolproof system, but we are evaluating other options to prevent abuse of the referral code system.

## Code Redemption
Each user can only enter one referral code. Once a code is entered, it cannot be changed or replaced.

## Rewards
Both the user who enters the referral code and the owner of the code will earn 150 tickets upon redemption.

Please note that the referral code system is subject to change and that the tickets earned through referrals may not be redeemable for cash or other forms of compensation.

Thank you for using our platform and we hope you enjoy the referral code system! If you have any questions, please contact us at our [support portal](https://framework.soodam.rocks/support). We are always happy to help!
