title: Federation Policy
description: Find out how Framework handles federation with other instances.
---

The Framework platform is a federated network, meaning that it is composed of multiple interconnected servers. As such, we have established the following policy for joining and participating in the main Framework fediverse.

## Requirements for Joining the Main Framework Fediverse

To join the main Framework fediverse, servers must implement our moderation resources, standards, and guidelines as outlined in our documentation.

- Servers must also integrate with the main Framework instance to ensure a seamless user experience for all members of the fediverse.
- Servers must comply with the terms outlined in our terms of service and community guidelines.
- The server administrator must agree to the license terms outlined in this policy.

## License

By joining the main Framework fediverse, server administrators agree to license their server's content under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

## Private Communities

Framework allows for private communities within the fediverse, as long as they comply with the terms outlined in our terms of service and community guidelines. Private communities are not subject to the license outlined above and are not required to be part of the main Framework fediverse.

By joining the main Framework fediverse, server administrators agree to abide by the terms outlined in this federation policy. We reserve the right to revoke access to the main Framework fediverse for any server that does not comply with these terms.
