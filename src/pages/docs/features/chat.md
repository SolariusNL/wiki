The Websocket-based Chat Feature in Framework is a real-time communication feature for users to communicate with one another. The chat system is built using websockets, which allows for bi-directional communication between the client and server in real-time.

## Chat Flyout

The chat flyout is a new feature in Framework that allows users to quickly access the chat system from anywhere on the site. The chat flyout is accessible by clicking the Chat in the bottom right corner of the site. Once opened, the chat flyout displays a list of all ongoing conversations and allows users to start new ones.

You can toggle the chat flyout in the [application settings](https://framework.soodam.rocks/settings/application). You can also change the color of your chat bubbles in the application settings.

## Dedicated Chat Page

The dedicated chat page has been removed due to usability issues. We do not plan to bring it back in the future.

## Message Retention

The chat system in Framework retains the last 75 messages per conversation. We plan to make this configurable in the future.

# Conversations

We've recently added a new feature to Framework that allows users to create and manage conversations with other users. Before, users could only perform one-on-one conversations with other users. Now, users can create group conversations with multiple users.

## Customization

Users can customize their conversations by changing the conversation name and icon. This allows users to easily identify their conversations and makes it easier for them to manage their conversations.

## Moderation

Owners of conversations can moderate their conversations by removing users from the conversation. This allows owners to remove users who are being disruptive or abusive.

## Upcoming Features

The chat system in Framework is still in its early stages, and we plan to add more features in the future. Some of the features we plan to add include:

- Typing indicator
- Message reactions
- Message editing
- Message search

In conclusion, the websocket-based chat feature in Framework provides a fast, efficient, and convenient way for users to communicate with one another. The chat flyout and dedicated chat page make it easier for users to access and use the chat system, and the message retention ensures that important messages are not lost.
