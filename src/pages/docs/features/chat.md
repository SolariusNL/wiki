The Websocket-based Chat Feature in Framework is a real-time communication feature for players to communicate with one another. The chat system is built using websockets, which allows for bi-directional communication between the client and server in real-time.

## Chat Flyout

The chat flyout is a new feature in Framework that allows users to quickly access the chat system from anywhere on the site. The chat flyout is accessible by clicking the Chat in the bottom right corner of the site. Once opened, the chat flyout displays a list of all ongoing conversations and allows users to start new ones.

You can toggle the chat flyout in the [application settings](https://framework.solarius.me/settings/application). You can also change the color of your chat bubbles in the application settings.

## Message Retention

The chat system in Framework retains the last 75 messages per conversation. We plan to make this configurable in the future.

## Upcoming Features

The chat system in Framework is still in its early stages, and we plan to add more features in the future. Some of the features we plan to add include:

- Typing indicator
- Read receipts
- Message reactions
- Message editing
- Markdown support
- Message search

In conclusion, the websocket-based chat feature in Framework provides a fast, efficient, and convenient way for players to communicate with one another. The chat flyout and dedicated chat page make it easier for players to access and use the chat system, and the message retention ensures that important messages are not lost.
