The Websocket-based Chat Feature in Framework is a real-time communication feature for players to communicate with one another. The chat system is built using websockets, which allows for bi-directional communication between the client and server in real-time.

## Chat Flyout

The chat flyout is a new feature that is currently as a release-candidate that can be enabled through use of the preview program. It provides a quick and convenient way for players to access the chat system from anywhere on the platform.

## Dedicated Chat Page

Soodam.re has replaced the traditional messages page with a dedicated chat page. This page allows players to view all their ongoing conversations and start new ones. The chat page provides a clear overview of all messages and makes it easier for players to navigate and find the conversation they are looking for.

## Message Retention

The chat system in Framework retains the last 75 messages per conversation. We plan to make this configurable in the future.

## Upcoming Features

The chat system in Framework is still in its early stages, and we plan to add more features in the future. Some of the features we plan to add include:

- Typing indicator
- Read receipts
- Message reactions
- Message editing
- Markdown support
- Message search

In conclusion, the websocket-based chat feature in Framework provides a fast, efficient, and convenient way for players to communicate with one another. The chat flyout and dedicated chat page make it easier for players to access and use the chat system, and the message retention ensures that important messages are not lost.
