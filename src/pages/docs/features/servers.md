The Servers interface provides a user-friendly way to manage and interact with your Cosmic servers, which is our platform for self-hosting games on Framework.

## Introduction

The server management interface is a web-based tool available on the Framework site that allows you to easily manage and control your Cosmic servers. With this interface, you can perform various tasks such as advanced-searching for servers, creating new servers, monitoring server logs, executing commands remotely, and more.

## Getting Started

To access the Server Management Interface, you need to log in to your Framework account, click your user in the top right and click `Developers`. You'll be taken to the Server dashboard. Once there, you will be presented with a user-friendly interface that allows you to perform various server management tasks.

## Features

### Advanced Searching

Servers provide san advanced search system that allows you to easily find servers based on specific criteria. You can search for servers by their IP address, game name, or game ID. Additionally, you have the option to filter servers based on their online or offline status, and sort by IP address & port.

### Creating Servers

You can easily create new Cosmic servers from the server interface. The interface provides a simple and intuitive form where you can enter the necessary details such as the server name, configuration, and other relevant settings. Once you submit the form, the new server will be provisioned and made available for hosting your game.

### Error Logs

The interface includes an error log feature that allows you to monitor and track any errors or issues that occur on your servers. The error log provides detailed information about the errors, including timestamps and error messages. This helps you quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise during the operation of your servers to minimize downtime and ensure that your games are running smoothly.

### CI/CD

The interface offers seamless integration with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) systems. You can configure your CI/CD pipelines to automatically deploy your games to the Cosmic servers, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development workflow. The interface provides detailed documentation on how to set up and configure CI/CD integration for your projects.

CI/CD is an up-and-coming technology that is becoming increasingly popular among developers. It allows you to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your applications, which helps you save time and increase productivity.

### Server Detail View

The interface provides detailed server information. It displays information such as the server's IP address, port, associated game, current status (online/offline), and other relevant details. From this view, you can access additional features such as polling server logs and executing commands remotely.

### Remote Command Execution

The interface allows you to execute commands remotely on your servers. This feature is useful for performing various tasks such as restarting the server, updating the game, and more. You can also use this feature to run custom scripts on your servers.

You can also pass arguments to the commands that you execute remotely. This allows you to perform more complex tasks such as running multiple commands in sequence or executing commands with different parameters.

### Remote Shutdown

In the event that your server becomes unresponsive or crashes, you can use the interface to remotely shut down the server for troubleshooting purposes. This feature is useful for resolving issues that may arise during the operation of your servers.

## Conclusion

The server management interface is a powerful tool that allows you to easily manage and control your Cosmic servers. It provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to perform various tasks such as creating new servers, monitoring server logs, executing commands remotely, and more. The interface also offers seamless integration with CI/CD systems, allowing you to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your applications. Overall, the server management interface is an excellent tool for managing your Cosmic servers, especially due to the fact that it is built right into Framework!

Happy building!
