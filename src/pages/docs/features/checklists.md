description: Use the Checklists feature in Framework to manage tasks and stay organized.
---

The Checklists feature provides a convenient and organized way for users to manage tasks and keep track of their progress. The feature allows users to sort, filter, and manage tasks by tags and schedule dates.

Common use cases for the Checklists feature include:

- Managing tasks for a Framework game
- Keeping track of deadlines, assignments, and projects
- and more

## Sorting

Checklists allows users to sort their tasks by various criteria, such as due date, priority, and tag. This makes it easier for users to find and manage their tasks, and ensures that important tasks are not overlooked.

## Filtering

Checklists also includes a filtering function, which allows users to narrow down their task list by tag, due date, and completion status. This makes it easier for users to focus on the tasks that are most relevant to them at any given time.

| Filter   | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| All      | Shows all tasks               |
| Past Due | Shows tasks that are past due |

## Managing Tasks by Tags

Users can add tags to their tasks, which allows them to group tasks by category and manage them more efficiently. For example, a user can add a tag called "Framework" to all their tasks related to Framework, and then filter their tasks by the "Framework" tag to view only those tasks.

## Schedule Dates

You can add a schedule date to your tasks, which allows you to keep track of tasks that are due on a specific date. This makes it easier for you to manage your tasks and stay on top of your deadlines.

Tasks that are past due are highlighted in red, otherwise they are unstyled.

Checklists provides users with a powerful tool to manage their tasks and stay organized. The sorting, filtering, tag management, and scheduling capabilities make it easy for users to stay on top of their tasks and achieve their goals.
