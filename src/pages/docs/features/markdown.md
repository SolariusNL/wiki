## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write text using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 with the goal of enabling people to write using plain text formatting that can be easily converted into HTML.

Markdown is widely used by bloggers, writers, and developers to format text on websites, blogs, and in documentation. The basic syntax of Markdown is simple and easy to learn, making it a popular choice for formatting text on the web.

## Basic Syntax

Here are some basic syntax rules for Markdown:

- **Bold Text**: To make text bold, surround the text with double asterisks, like this: `**bold**`
- **Italic Text**: To italicize text, surround the text with single asterisks, like this: `*italic*`
- **Inline Code**: To format text as code, surround the text with backticks, like this: `` `inline code` ``
- **Code Block**: To format a block of code, indent the entire block with four spaces or one tab
- **Headers**: To create a header, add one or more hash symbols before the text, like this: `# Header 1`, `## Header 2`, `### Header 3`
- **Lists**: To create a bulleted list, use dashes (`-`) or asterisks (`*`) followed by a space for each list item. To create a numbered list, use numbers followed by a period (`.`) and a space.
- **Links**: To create a hyperlink, surround the link text with square brackets, and the URL with parentheses, like this: `[link text](https://example.com)`
- **Mentions**: To mention someone, use the `@` symbol followed by their username, like this: `@username`
- **Line Breaks**: To create a line break, add two spaces at the end of a line
- **Horizontal Rules**: To create a horizontal rule, add three or more dashes, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves
- **Tables**: To create a table, add a header row and a divider row, and then add rows for your content. You can use pipes (`|`) to separate columns, and dashes (`-`) to create the divider row. See below for an example

## Features

Now let's take a closer look at the features of the new Markdown editor in Framework.

### Bold and Italic Text

To make text bold or italic, highlight the text you want to format and click the bold or italic button in the toolbar. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts `Meta+B` for bold and `Meta+I` for italic.

### Inline Code

To format text as code, surround the text with backticks (` `) or use the `Code` button in the toolbar. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Meta+K`.

### Code Blocks

To format a block of code, use the `Code Block` button in the toolbar or indent the entire block with four spaces or one tab.

### Headers

To create a header, highlight the text you want to format and select the appropriate header level in the toolbar. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Meta+{level}`, where `{level}` is the header level you want to use.

### Lists

To create a bulleted list, use the `Bullet List` button in the toolbar, or type a dash (`-`) or asterisk (`*`) followed by a space at the beginning of each line. To create a numbered list, use the `Numbered List` button in the toolbar, or type a number followed by a period (`.`) and a space at the beginning of each line.

### Links

To create a hyperlink, highlight the text you want to use as the link text and click the `Link` button in the toolbar. In the dialog that appears, enter the URL for the link. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Meta+L`.

### Mentions

To mention someone, type the `@` symbol followed by their username, like this: `@username`. We are working on a feature that will allow you to autocomplete usernames as you type.

### Line Breaks

To create a line break, add two spaces at the end of a line. A line break is a way to add a new line without starting a new paragraph.

### Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, add three or more dashes, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. A horizontal rule is a way to separate content into sections, through a visible divider.

### Tables

To create a table, add a header row and a divider row, and then add rows for your content. You can use pipes (`|`) to separate columns, and dashes (`-`) to create the divider row. See below for an example.

| Header 1  | Header 2  | Header 3  |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Content 1 | Content 2 | Content 3 |
| Content 1 | Content 2 | Content 3 |
