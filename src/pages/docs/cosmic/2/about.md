Cosmic 2.0 is a new update to the Cosmic server runtime. This version of Cosmic has been completely rewritten in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language and comes with a wide range of new features and improvements that make it even more powerful and efficient than ever before.

## Breaking changes

### Rust rewrite

The most significant change in Cosmic 2.0 is the complete rewrite of the server runtime in the Rust language. This change brings numerous benefits, including enhanced performance, memory safety, and concurrent execution. 

Rust's safety features ensure that Cosmic 2.0 is more secure and reliable, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from small-scale Framework games to large, complex & multi-tenant Framework games.

### Vortex Lua Interop

Cosmic 2.0 introduces integration with the Vortex engine through Lua scripting. This new feature allows developers to harness the power of Solarius' Vortex engine within Cosmic's runtime environment. By using Lua, you can easily build your games, create dynamic content, and implement complex logic using the Vortex engine's capabilities.
