When working with TypeScript, it is common to encounter situations where multiple packages or modules export entities with the same name. This can lead to conflicts and make it challenging to import and use these entities in your code. To resolve such conflicts and ensure proper usage of the desired entities, you can employ a technique called "import renaming." This documentation explains how to rename imports in TypeScript to resolve conflicts effectively.

## Renaming Imports

To rename imports in TypeScript, you can utilize the `as` keyword during the import statement. This allows you to assign a new name to the imported entity, avoiding conflicts with existing entities in your code. Here's an example of how to rename imports:

```ts
import { Entity as OtherEntity } from "package-1";
import { Entity as AnotherEntity } from "package-2";

// Now you can use OtherEntity and AnotherEntity in your code without conflicts
```

In the example above, the `Entity` entity is exported by both `package-1` and `package-2`. By using the `as` keyword, we rename the imports to `OtherEntity` and `AnotherEntity`, respectively. This allows you to refer to each entity with its new name throughout your code, eliminating conflicts.

## Usage of Renamed Imports

After renaming the imports, you can use the new names to refer to the imported entities in your code. For example:

```ts
import { Entity as OtherEntity } from "package-1";

const instance = new OtherEntity();
// Use the OtherEntity instance as needed
```

In the above code snippet, the `OtherEntity` is used as the renamed import. You can create new instances, call methods, or access properties of the renamed entity as usual.

## Benefits of Renaming Imports

Renaming imports provides several benefits, including:

- **Conflict resolution**: By renaming imports, you can avoid naming conflicts when multiple packages or modules export entities with the same name.

- **Clarity and readability**: Renaming imports can improve code clarity and readability by using more descriptive names that align with their purpose or origin.

- **Maintainability**: Renaming imports makes it easier to track and understand which package or module an entity originates from, enhancing code maintainability and facilitating future updates or modifications.

## Conclusion

When encountering naming conflicts between imported entities in TypeScript, the technique of renaming imports can help resolve these conflicts effectively. By using the `as` keyword during import statements, you can assign new names to imported entities, enabling clear and conflict-free usage within your code. Renaming imports enhances code clarity, readability, and maintainability, contributing to a more organized and manageable TypeScript project.
