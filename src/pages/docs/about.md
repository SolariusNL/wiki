## Philosophy

At Soodam.re, we believe that gaming & game development should be open, collaborative, and decentralized. We believe that creativity and innovation thrive when they are free from the constraints of corporate control and censorship. We believe that game development is not just about creating games, but also about fostering a community of developers who can collaborate, share ideas, and learn from each other.

We also believe in the power of technology to bring people together and to empower them to create and share their ideas with the world. We believe that by using decentralized and federated technologies, we can create a platform that is more secure, more private, and more resilient than traditional centralized platforms.

Finally, we believe that by embracing open-source development, we can create a more innovative and collaborative platform. By allowing anyone to contribute to the development of the platform, we can tap into the collective creativity and expertise of the entire gaming community, and we can create a platform that is more robust and more innovative than any other platform out there.

In summary, our philosophy is about empowering game developers to create and share their ideas with the world, while also fostering a collaborative and open community of developers who can learn from each other and push the boundaries of what's possible in game development.

## Privacy

We take user privacy very seriously. We believe that user data should be treated with the utmost respect and care, and we have taken steps to ensure that our platform is as secure and private as possible.

### Decentralized and Federated

One of the main ways that we protect user privacy is by using decentralized and federated technologies. This means that the data generated by users on our platform is not stored in a central location, but is distributed across a network of servers. This makes it much more difficult for hackers and other malicious actors to gain access to user data, since they would need to compromise multiple servers to gain access to a user's data.

In addition, by using federated technologies, we ensure that users can interact with our platform without having to provide excess amounts of personal information. Users can remain anonymous if they wish, and still be able to use our platform to create and share their games.

### Encrypted Data

Another way that we protect user privacy is by encrypting all user data. This means that any data that is transmitted between users and our servers is encrypted, making it much more difficult for anyone to intercept and read the data.

### No Advertising

We do not sell user data to advertisers or other third parties. We believe that user data should be kept private, and that users should have control over how their data is used. As a result, we do not display ads on our platform, and we do not use user data to target ads to users.

### Open-Source Code

All of the code that we use to build our platform is open source, which means that anyone can review the code and ensure that it does not contain any malicious or privacy-invasive code. This helps to build trust with our users, and ensures that our platform is as secure and private as possible.

Privacy is a top priority for us at Soodam.re. We believe that user data should be treated with the utmost care and respect, and we have taken steps to ensure that our platform is as secure and private as possible. By using decentralized and federated technologies, encrypting user data, and not displaying ads, we are able to offer users a more private and secure gaming experience.

## Licensing

We are committed to the principles of open-source software. We believe that open-source software is the future of software development, and that it offers numerous benefits over proprietary software. As a result, we have chosen to license our platform under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), which is a strong copyleft license that ensures that any derivative works based on our platform must also be open source.

### What is the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)?

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free software license that was created by the Free Software Foundation. It is a strong copyleft license, which means that any derivative works based on the licensed software must also be licensed under the same license, and must be made available to the public. The AGPL is similar to the GNU General Public License (GPL), but with an additional clause that covers software that is used over a network, such as web applications and online services.

### Why did we choose the AGPL?

We chose the AGPL for several reasons. First and foremost, we believe that open-source software is the future of software development. Open-source software is more transparent, more secure, and more flexible than proprietary software, and it fosters a collaborative and supportive community of developers. By licensing our platform under the AGPL, we are ensuring that it remains open and accessible to all, and that any derivative works based on our platform are also open source.

In addition, the AGPL helps to protect the rights of users and developers. By requiring derivative works to be open source, we are ensuring that the platform remains accessible to all, and that no one can lock users or developers into a proprietary ecosystem. This is particularly important for a platform like Framework, which is designed to grant freedoms, liberties and features that other gaming platforms like Roblox never offered.

Finally, the AGPL helps to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform. By requiring derivative works to be open source, we are encouraging a community of developers to build on our platform, which can lead to a more diverse and innovative ecosystem of applications. This can help to ensure that our platform remains relevant and useful for years to come.

### Benefits of the AGPL

There are several benefits to licensing our platform under the AGPL:

- Ensures that our platform remains open and accessible to all
- Protects the rights of users and developers
- Encourages a diverse and innovative ecosystem of applications
  -Helps to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform

TL;DR, the AGPL is a strong copyleft license that ensures that our platform remains open and accessible to all, and that any derivative works based on our platform must also be open source. By choosing the AGPL, we are committed to the principles of open-source software, and we are helping to create a more collaborative and supportive community of developers.

## Power of Community

The power of community is one of the most important aspects of our platform. We believe that a strong and supportive community is essential to the success of any platform, and that it can help to drive innovation, foster collaboration, and provide a sense of belonging to users and developers alike.

Our platform is designed to be decentralized and federated, which means that users and developers can create their own instances of the platform, called "nodes", and connect with other nodes to form a larger network. This decentralized and federated model ensures that the power of the platform is distributed across the community, and not concentrated in the hands of a single entity. This can help to prevent issues like censorship, data privacy violations, and abuse of power that have plagued other centralized platforms.

In addition, our platform is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) (as mentioned above), which means that it is open source and accessible to all. This helps to encourage a community of developers to build on the platform, which can lead to a more diverse and innovative ecosystem of applications. The AGPL also ensures that any derivative works based on the platform must also be open source, which helps to prevent any one entity from monopolizing the platform and stifling innovation.

By creating a strong and supportive community around our platform, we are empowering users and developers to take ownership of their own online experiences. This can lead to a more democratic and equitable online environment, where users and developers have a say in the development and direction of the platform. In addition, a strong community can help to drive innovation, as users and developers collaborate and share ideas and resources.

On our platform, users and developers can connect with each other through a variety of channels, such as forums, chat rooms, and collaborative development tools. This helps to foster a sense of belonging and community, and can provide a support system for users and developers as they navigate the platform and build their own applications.

In summary, the power of community is a fundamental aspect of our platform. Our decentralized and federated model, combined with the open-source licensing of the platform, helps to distribute power across the community and prevent any one entity from monopolizing the platform. By empowering users and developers to take ownership of their own online experiences, we are creating a more democratic and equitable online environment, where innovation and collaboration can thrive.
